			<h1 align=center style="color:black;">Jumping Jacks</h1><br>
			<p> Here we have one of the most basic and common forms of exercise however offers many great benefits. This is the jumping jack which can be used as either a warmup or cooldown exercise as it is light to moderate in terms of physical activity. To do the jumping jack, stand upright your legs togethers, arms at the side. Bend your knees slightly and jump into the air. As you jump, spread your legs to be about shoulder-width apart. Stretch your arms out and over your head. Jump back into the starting position and continue to repeat this process. Do for for about 2-3 minutes for 3 repitions or it can be included as an excercise in-between heavier activity (i.e. allows you to keep your blood pumping).

					<h1 align=center style="color:black;">Leg Lifts</h1><br>
						<p> Here we have another simple yet killing exercise for your abdominals. This is the leg lifts which will kill your abs within a minute. Think of it like the reverse plank. In this exercise, lie on your back with your legs straight and together. Keep your legs straight and lift them all the way up the ceiling until your butt comes off the floor. After that slowly lower your legs back down till they're just above the floor and then hold for a moment. Continue to repeat this process by doing 3 sets of 12 or do it until failure to get the maximum affect and burn!

				<h1 align=center style="color:black;">Weightless Squats</h1><br>
					<p> Another common exercise in our artillery is the weightless squat. Many people think you need a barbell and some plates to do squats however that's not true at all depending on your goals (i.e. powerlifter). In this exercise, stand with your hands on the back of your head and your feed shoulder-width apart with your feet turned out slightly to open the hip joint. Lower your body until your thighs are parallel to the floor similar to the images above. Pause, then return to the starting position. Repeat this process for 3 sets by 10-12 repitions for a solid exercise. This can be increased if you have experience in physical training as it is weightless.

				<h1 align=center style="color:black;">Sit-Ups</h1><br>
					<p> One of my favorite exercises, known as the sit-up. The sit-up is a very simple yet powerful exercise if done with the correct form. First off, lie down on your back and bend your legs to stabilize your lower body. Cross your hands to opposite shoulders, or place them behind your ears with pulling on your neck. After that, lift your head and shoulder blades from the ground. Then return to the starting position and repeat this process following our 3 sets by 12 repitions. There are many ways to cheat in this exercise such as moving your arms around or not lifting your body and just your head so ensure that you focus on the quality of the sit-up and not the quantity as it plays a major part in how effective this exercise is!
